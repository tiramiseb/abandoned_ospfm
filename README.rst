*OSPFM* stands for *Open Source Personal Finance Management server*.

OSPFM is the foundation for a future Software-as-a-Service finance application,
named everCount.

Documentation as HTML
=====================

To convert  all documentation  to HTML,  you need the  docutils tool  (from the
python-docutils  package  in some  Linux  distributions).  Simply  execute  the
``docs-to-html.sh`` script in the project's root directory. Every ``.rst`` file
will then have a HTML equivalent.

When you read them online on the GitHub website,  these files are automatically
converted.

Manifesto
=========

To  understand  the motivation  behind  OSPFM,  please  read  the  manifesto in
``MANIFESTO.rst``.
